Hello All!

Toboggan Flights is ideal for the budget conscious traveler who is trying to get the best bang for their buck!

Using various APIs (to be listed at a later date), we look to prove that saving money on flights is relatively easy.

_It should be noted that Adrian did very little work on this project and was more or less a general distraction and nuisance. As a rule of thumb, Adrian believes his work at Google makes him superior to other people, which is utter garbage. You suck Adrian. Don't ever forget that._
